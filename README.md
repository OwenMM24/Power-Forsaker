# GMTK2023 README

Please make sure to place all files and make all commits inside the GMTK2023 folder. Not doing so can cause weird occurences.

joshua-experimental is where I will test out features and add them to main once they are in a good state. If you'd like to commit, either commit directly to main, or create your own branch.
